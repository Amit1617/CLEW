<h2>For the Research Study "Creation of Assistive Technology for the Blind Through Largescale Co-Design"</h2>

<p>
This study is being conducted by Paul Ruvolo, a Professor at Olin College of Engineering.
</p>

<p>Please read this information carefully - it tells you about your rights in this study. If you want to ask questions about the study, you can do so by sending an e-mail to paul.ruvolo@olin.edu or by calling him at 650-279-8868.  You are free to delay your participation in the study until your questions have been addressed satisfactorily.</p>

<p>
If you decide to participate in this study you will indicate your consent to participate by providing your e-mail at the end of this form - make sure you understand it completely before indicating your consent. We will give you a copy of this form to keep - it has important information like whom to contact if you have questions later.  Your e-mail address will not be connected to the data you generate as part of the study, however, we will use it for the purposes of sending you a gift card to compensate you for your participation.
</p>

<h2>What is this study about?</h2>

<p>
This study is designed to evaluate the potential for smartphones to allow people who are blind to record and navigate along indoor routes.  From this study we hope to be able to determine when the current system works well, when it fails, and how we might improve it to work better for you and other folks who are blind.
</p>


<h2>Who are we asking to participate?</h2>

<p>Anyone over the age of 18 who is blind.  While there are many definitions of blindness, to participate in this study you must rely primarily on your non-visual senses in order to navigate and move around in your environment.</p>


<h2>What will you be asked to do?</h2>

<p>This study will consist of using a prototype app for indoor route recording and navigation.  The app has two main functions.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Route recording:</b> in the route recording phase you will be able to record a route as you move through your environment.  You can access the record route feature  by activating the "record route" button and following the in-app instructions. For the purposes of this study we ask that you record routes only within a safe, familiar environment that you can navigate easily.</li>
<li><b>Route navigation:</b> in the route navigation phase you will load one of your recorded routers using the "load route" button in the app and following the in-app instructions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
At the conclusion of route navigation, you can provide your feedback by recording a voice note through the app.  The experimenters will listen to your voice feedback in order to better understand how you felt the app performed.  We welcome any feedback you have on the app (e.g., ease of use, accuracy).
</p>

<p>
In addition to your verbal feedback, the app will log data from your phone.  We will use this data to better understand how the app functions when you are using it.  The data will include readings from your phone's motion sensors as well as images collected from the rear-facing camera.  We will not log any GPS information from your phone.  The data we collect in this study will not be made available to anyone outside of Dr. Ruvolo's research group.
</p>

<h2>Are there any possible risks to you?</h2>

<p>Since you will be using an unfamiliar technology for navigation, there is a risk that you could become disoriented and physically injure yourself.  In order to lessen the chance of this happening, we ask that you test the app in an environment that you can navigate easily.  We also ask that you continue to use your primary orientation and mobility tools (e.g., a mobility cane) while using this app.  This app is intended to augment, not replace, such tools.</p>

<p>Your information could be accidently leaked to people not connected with this study. We will do everything we can to make sure this doesn't happen.</p>

<h2>Will you benefit from participation?</h2>

<p>The technology being developed in this study may make its way into a consumer product that you can use.  You may benefit from the utility of the app that you will be helping to design.</p>

<h2>Will it cost you anything to participate?</h2>

<p>Just the time it takes to complete the study.</p>

<h2>Will you receive anything for participating in the study?</h2>
<p>You will be given a $20 Amazon Gift Card for participating in the study.  In order to receive the $20 Amazon Gift Card you must record and navigate at least three routes.</p>


<h2>How will your information be kept private?</h2>

<p>
We will not share any raw data from this study with anyone outside of the research team. The data you generate will be summarized in a research paper, but your participation will not be disclosed in the paper (or in any other venue).  We will store the data in such a way that if the data were to be compromised, it would not be traceable to your e-mail address.  Despite these precauations, in the event that the data were to be compromised, it is possible that your identity might be determined through sensor data collected from your phone (e.g., if there is an identifying feature in one of the camera images).  To help prevent this from happening, we will be deleting any images collected from your phone that contain people (yourself or anyone else).</p>

<p>We will not quote you without your permission. If we want to quote you, we will ask you to sign another consent form.</p>

<h2>What will happen with your data after this study?</h2>
<p>
We will store the data - disconnected from your e-mail address - indefinitely.</p>

<h2>What if you don't want to participate or change your mind partway through?</h2>

<p>Participating in this study is completely voluntary. You can refuse to participate or quit at any time.</p>

<h2>Who can you call if you have more questions?</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about the research or your participation in the study, feel free to contact Dr. Ruvolo at 650-279-8868 or Paul.Ruvolo@olin.edu.</p>

<p>This research was approved by an office/committee that oversees the ethics of research at Brandeis University. If you have any questions about your rights - or if you have concerns about the study - you may contact them at 781-736-8133 or irb@brandeis.edu.</p>
