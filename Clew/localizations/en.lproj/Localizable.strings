While this technology is advanced, it does not work perfectly. You should expect that over very long routes, particular ones with limited visual features or poor lighting, that the accuracy of the tracking (and hence the app's guidance) will decrease.

To make it easy to return the phone to the same orientation, you should hold your phone flat with the screen facing up and press the top (short-edge) of your phone flush with a vertical surface (like a wall).
