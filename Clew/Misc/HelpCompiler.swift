        <p>The video below provides a basic overview of how the app functions. The video should be accessible to folks regardless of level of vision, but if any of it is unclear, please submit feedback to us through the \"Give Feedback\" menu.</p>

        """),("Obtaining the NFC Tags","""
            <p>As mentioned in the video overview, in order to register a place with Clew Maps, you must have an NFC tag.  NFC tags can be purchased at a low cost from many online retailers.  Here is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/THONSEN-NTAG215-NFC-enabled-Smartphones-Devices/dp/B074M9J5L3/ref=sr_1_5?crid=165E0S0UDPIDG&keywords=NFC+cards&qid=1652107713&sprefix=nfc+car%2Caps%2C297&sr=8-5\">a listing from the US Amazon Store</a> for 25 NFC cards.</p>
           """),("Obtaining the Tag Image of a Tree","""
                <p>As mentioned in the video overview, places in Clew Maps must be marked with both an NFC tag and a special image.  The image contains a picture of a tree with a black and yellow border.  We have PDFs for both <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12Qi8qqvU5CoBhHfVSqzVI7dEd4Oks__k/view?usp=sharing\">US Letter Paper</a> and <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1agFlpbXz2TYr0WVFXEm1oqco79obSM6U/view?usp=sharing\">A4 Paper</a> available.  It is best to print the images in color, but black and white is okay too.</p>
        """),("Tips for Installing the Image and the NFC Tag","""
                <p>As mentioned in the video overview, you need to install the NFC tag and the image of the tree at the start of any route.  Here are some tips to ehlp you do this well.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a location that is easy to find without assistance from the app for your tag.</li>
                    <li>Choose a location that will not move for mounting your tag (e.g., don't choose a movable partition or wall).</li>
                    <li>You can place the NFC card underneath the image of the tree (printed tag), to make it easy to find the tree image once you have scanned the NFC card, but that is not a required.</li>
                    <li>To make the tag easier to find for folks with no functional vision, consider adding tactile indicators around the printed tree image (e.g., bump dot stickers).</li>
                    <li>Make sure not to obscure the printed image of the tree when you install it in your environment.  This image needs to be visible in order for the app to align properly.</li>
