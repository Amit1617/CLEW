        <source>The procedure for pausing the route and recording an anchor point are the same. The key idea is that in order to reuse routes, your phone must be able to align its current position with a position from the recorded route. In some cases, Apple's ARKit will be able to automatically do this alignment (for example, when the camera sees a distinctive visual feature that can be matched to the recording); however, in many situations this will not be possible.</source>

        <source>In order to align your position in such cases you must be able to place the phone in a position and orientation such that you can reliably return the phone to that same position and orientation when reloading a saved route. While it is not crucial that you position the phone in exactly the same place (although the more accurately you can do this, the better the app will work), you must be able to place the phone in precisely the same orientation. To make it easy to return the phone to the same orientation, you should hold your phone flat with the screen facing up and press the top (short-edge) of your phone flush with a vertical surface (like a wall). More instructions are provided in the app when you activate the pause feature or the create anchor point feature.</source>

        <source>Clew relies on the position tracking technology provided by Apple's ARKit. These motion estimates are based on tracking elements in the environment visually (using your phone's camera) and on motion estimates from inertial sensors in your phone. While this technology is advanced, it does not work perfectly. You should expect that over very long routes, particular ones with limited visual features or poor lighting, that the accuracy of the tracking (and hence the app's guidance) will decrease. We have found that Clew works best when you navigate routes along the same direction as they were originally recorded (&amp;quot;Start to End &amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;End to Start &amp;quot; navigation mode).</source>

        <source>To allow your route to be navigated in the reverse direction you need to record an anchor point for the end of your route. An anchor point records the position and alignment of your device so the app can reload your route from a saved file. As a result the accuracy of your saved route navigation relies entirely on how accurately you can realign and position your phone with your saved anchor point at a later point. We suggest using the text and voice note buttons to record a text note and/or a voice recording which can help you realign your device to the anchor point you recorded at a later time.
To create an anchor point, hold your device flat with the screen facing up. Press the top (short) edge flush against a flat vertical surface (such as a wall) the ”align” button starts a %lu-second countdown. The countdown is intended to give you time to position your device; the anchor point will be saved at the end of the countdown.</source>

The app will not work if the phone is in your pocket or if any part of your body is blocking your phone's rear camera. We have found that the app works best when you hold the phone in portrait orientation with the rear camera facing directly ahead of you and the phone oriented vertically. Other orientations can work, but may result in diminished accuracy.</target>

        <source>To be able to resume your tracking at a later point you need to record an anchor point for the end of your route. An anchor point records the position and alignment of your device so the app can reload your route from a temporary file. As a result the accuracy of your return navigation relies entirely on how accurately you can realign and position your phone with your saved anchor point at a later point. We suggest using the text and voice note buttons to record a text note and/or a voice recording which can help you realign your device to the anchor point you recorded at a later time.
To create an anchor point, hold your device flat with the screen facing up. Press the top (short) edge flush against a flat vertical surface (such as a wall) the ”align” button starts a %lu-second countdown. The countdown is intended to give you time to position your device; the anchor point will be saved at the end of the countdown.</source>
